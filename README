DISCLAIMER:
This software has a high chance of breaking your ability to use
windows. Not windows like the operating system, but windows like the
things on your screen which let you use apps.

If you run into issues, ctrl+alt+end (restart enlightenment) is your best bet.
This is a proof of concept project and will not be actively developed
unless other developers decide to pick it up.


To use:

1) Install compiz-0.8.* plugins
2) Install compiz settings manager (ccsm)
3) Enable window effects using ccsm (eg. wobbly)
4) Set EVAS_GL_UNSAFE_EXTENSIONS=1 EVAS_GL_NO_BLACKLIST=1
4.5) Hope JP doesn't notice
5) Start enlightenment from git
6) Load compiz module
7) Pray



Known issues:
* Screen effects are not yet supported
* Live previews of windows in enlightenment (eg. pager) do not work
  while this module is enabled
* Disabling the module requires a compositor restart to fix rendering
* Window shading animations may or may not work
* Desk flips look weird


Known working effect plugins:
* wobbly
* animation
